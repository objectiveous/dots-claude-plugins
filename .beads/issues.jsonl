{"id":"dots-claude-plugins-3e5","title":"Claude calls Skill tool when command already loaded","description":"## Bug\n\nWhen user invokes a skill directly (e.g., `/dots-swe:status`), the system loads the skill with `\u003ccommand-message\u003e` and `\u003ccommand-name\u003e` tags.

{"id":"dots-claude-plugins-65l","title":"SWE agents skip quality gates before committing","description":"## Problem\n\nSWE agents (including Claude) consistently skip quality gates (process-check/code-complete) before committing code, despite having guidance to run them. This defeats the purpose of having automated quality checks.\n\n**Recent Example:**\n- dots-claude-plugins-ztt: Fixed Skill tool hanging bug\n- Changes: Modified 11 command files + created documentation\n- Committed and closed bead WITHOUT running quality gates\n- No tests, no lint, no verification the fix actually works\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n### 1. bd prime's SESSION CLOSE PROTOCOL is Incomplete\n\nThe `bd prime` command (from beads-marketplace) outputs a SESSION CLOSE PROTOCOL that does NOT include quality gates:\n\n**Current output (ephemeral branch mode):**\n```\n[ ] 1. git status              (check what changed)\n[ ] 2. git add \u003cfiles\u003e         (stage code changes)\n[ ] 3. bd sync --from-main     (pull beads updates from main)\n[ ] 4. git commit -m \"...\"     (commit code changes)\n```\n\n**What's missing:** Step 0 should be \"Run quality gates\"\n\n### 2. Competing/Conflicting Guidance\n\nMultiple sources provide guidance, creating confusion:\n\n- **bd prime SESSION CLOSE PROTOCOL**: No quality gates mentioned\n- **.swe-context Quick Reference**: Says \"Run /dots-swe:process-check before committing\"\n- **.swe-context Quality Checklist**: Has checkboxes but no enforcement\n- **CLAUDE.md Session Completion Protocol**: Mentions quality gates but less prominent\n\nAgents follow the most prominent/structured checklist (SESSION CLOSE PROTOCOL) which is incomplete.\n\n### 3. No Enforcement Mechanism\n\nNothing prevents commits without quality gates:\n- No pre-commit hooks to verify\n- No TodoWrite template that includes quality gates step\n- Acceptance criteria in beads don't include \"run quality gates\" by default\n- Agents create implementation todos but don't add \"verify with tests\" as final step\n\n### 4. bd prime is Not Our Code\n\nThe `bd prime` command lives in `beads-marketplace` (Steve Yegge's repo), not `dots-claude-plugins`. We cannot modify it directly.\n\n**Source:** `/Users/robert/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/beads-marketplace/cmd/bd/prime.go`\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Quality Issues**: Code committed without verification\n- **Broken Fixes**: Changes that might not actually work\n- **Protocol Violation**: Defeats purpose of having /dots-swe:process-check and /dots-swe:code-complete\n- **Normalization**: If agents skip it once, they'll keep skipping it\n- **Wasted Effort**: Bugs that should be caught in development slip through\n\n## Why This Happened on dots-claude-plugins-ztt\n\n1. Agent created todo list: \"Fix files\", \"Document pattern\", \"Commit changes\"\n2. No todo added for \"Run quality gates\"\n3. Followed bd prime's SESSION CLOSE PROTOCOL checklist (no quality gates)\n4. Ignored .swe-context guidance (less structured, buried in middle of file)\n5. No enforcement stopped the commit\n6. Result: Committed untested changes, closed bead\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n**Create our own prime command in dots-swe that replaces bd prime's output**\n\n```\ndots-swe/commands/prime.md\n```\n\nThis command would:\n1. Call bd prime to get base context\n2. Override/inject the SESSION CLOSE PROTOCOL with our enhanced version\n3. Include quality gates as Step 0 (mandatory)\n4. Adapt based on project type (skip if no tests/lint detected)\n\n**Enhanced SESSION CLOSE PROTOCOL (ephemeral branch):**\n```\n[ ] 0. Run quality gates        (/dots-swe:process-check OR /dots-swe:code-complete)\n[ ] 1. git status              (check what changed)\n[ ] 2. git add \u003cfiles\u003e         (stage code changes)\n[ ] 3. bd sync --from-main     (pull beads updates from main)\n[ ] 4. git commit -m \"...\"     (commit code changes)\n```\n\n**Implementation Strategy:**\n- Make it a SessionStart hook in dots-swe (runs instead of bd prime)\n- Detect if project has tests/lint (Makefile, package.json, etc.)\n- Output appropriate protocol based on context\n- Keep compatibility with bd prime's modes (MCP, stealth, ephemeral)\n\n## Alternative Solutions Considered\n\n1. **Pre-commit git hook**: Too restrictive, blocks agent autonomy\n2. **TodoWrite template**: Agents don't always use TodoWrite for all tasks\n3. **Update .swe-context**: Already has guidance, agents ignore it\n4. **Update CLAUDE.md**: Less effective than prominent checklist\n5. **Modify bd prime**: Not our code, can't change it\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Create /dots-swe:prime command that enhances bd prime output\n- [ ] Add quality gates as Step 0 in SESSION CLOSE PROTOCOL\n- [ ] Make it project-aware (detect test/lint/build tools)\n- [ ] Set up as SessionStart hook to replace bd prime\n- [ ] Test with ephemeral branch workflow\n- [ ] Test with MCP mode\n- [ ] Document the override mechanism\n- [ ] Verify agents actually run quality gates before committing\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n\n- `dots-swe/commands/prime.md` - New command\n- `dots-swe/scripts/prime.sh` - Implementation script\n- `dots-swe/hooks/hooks.json` - Update SessionStart hook\n- `docs/quality-gates-enforcement.md` - Documentation\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n1. Create test bead with code changes\n2. Agent works on it in worktree with dots-swe:prime\n3. Verify agent sees enhanced SESSION CLOSE PROTOCOL\n4.

{"id":"dots-claude-plugins-9gg","title":"Update SWE agent instructions to mandate code-complete before closing beads","description":"## Problem\n\nThe SWE agent instructions (dots-swe/agents/swe.md) do not explicitly mandate running /dots-swe:code-complete before closing beads, leading agents to skip this critical step.\n\nRecent violations:\n- dots-claude-plugins-5va: Closed bead without code-complete\n- dots-claude-plugins-ztt: Closed bead without quality gates\n- Multiple historical instances documented in dots-claude-plugins-65l\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n### Current SWE Agent Guidance Gaps\n\n1. **No explicit code-complete requirement**: swe.md mentions quality gates in abstract terms but doesn't mandate /dots-swe:code-complete as a pre-closing step\n\n2. **Workflow section incomplete**: The workflow example shows:\n   - Load context\n   - Implement changes\n   - Commit with Conventional Commits format\n   - ❌ **MISSING**: Run code-complete before closing\n\n3. **Bead closing guidance absent**: No section on \"How to properly close a bead\" or \"Final steps before completion\"\n\n4. **Quality gates mentioned but not enforced**:\n   - Quality Bar section exists (line ~150)\n   - Mentions test/lint/build\n   - But doesn't tie it to code-complete command\n   - Doesn't say \"run this before closing\"\n\n5. **Command reference scattered**:\n   - /dots-swe:process-check mentioned for interim checks\n   - /dots-swe:code-complete not prominently featured\n   - Distinction between them unclear\n\n6. **Agent behavior pattern**:\n   - Agents implement features correctly\n   - Run tests during development (if prompted)\n   - But skip final verification before saying \"done\"\n   - Jump straight to: commit → close bead → \"complete\"\n\n### Why Agents Skip This Step\n\n**Cognitive pattern**:\n1. Agent completes implementation\n2. Code looks correct\n3. Agent commits changes\n4. Agent marks bead closed\n5. Agent says \"implementation complete\"\n\n**Missing trigger**: Nothing in instructions says \"STOP - run code-complete first\"\n\n**False completion signal**: Committing code feels like \"done\" to the agent\n\n## Solution: Mandatory Code-Complete Section\n\nAdd explicit, impossible-to-miss guidance in swe.md that mandates code-complete before closing beads.\n\n### New Section: \"CRITICAL: Before Closing Any Bead\"\n\nInsert prominently after Quality Bar section (around line ~180):\n\n```markdown\n## CRITICAL: Before Closing Any Bead\n\nYou MUST run `/dots-swe:code-complete` before closing a bead or saying you're \"done\". This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.\n\n### What Code-Complete Does\n\nThe `/dots-swe:code-complete` command is your final quality gate. It:\n\n1. **Runs all quality gates** (if detected):\n   - Tests: Ensures your changes don't break existing functionality\n   - Lint: Verifies code style and catches common errors\n   - Build: Confirms the project builds successfully\n\n2. **Pushes to remote**: Ensures your code is backed up and visible to CI\n\n3. **Labels the bead**: Adds `swe:code-complete` label indicating work is ready for integration\n\n4. **Displays summary**: Shows what was completed for verification\n\n### When to Run Code-Complete\n\nRun `/dots-swe:code-complete` when:\n- ✅ All acceptance criteria are met\n- ✅ All code changes are committed locally\n- ✅ You're about to close the bead\n- ✅ You're about to say \"done\" or \"complete\"\n\n**Before running**:\n1. Squash commits if needed: `/dots-swe:squash`\n2. Ensure all changes committed: `git status` should be clean\n3. Review your changes one final time\n\n**After running**:\n- If it succeeds: Proceed to close bead and integration\n- If it fails: Fix the issue, commit, run code-complete again\n\n### NEVER Do This\n\n❌ **WRONG: Close bead without code-complete**\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"feat: add feature\"\nbd close dots-abc-123\n# Agent: \"Implementation complete!\"\n```\n\n✅ **CORRECT: Code-complete, verify, then close**\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"feat: add feature\"\n/dots-swe:code-complete           # ← REQUIRED STEP\n# ... code-complete runs quality gates, pushes, labels ...\nbd close dots-abc-123              # Only after code-complete succeeds\n```\n\n### Why This Matters\n\nSkipping code-complete means:\n- ❌ Untested code gets merged\n- ❌ Build failures discovered during integration (too late)\n- ❌ Wasted time fixing issues that should have been caught earlier\n- ❌ Integration delays for other work\n- ❌ Loss of confidence in quality process\n\n### Quality Gates Failures\n\nIf `/dots-swe:code-complete` fails:\n\n1. **Read the error output carefully**\n2. **Identify which gate failed** (test/lint/build)\n3. **Fix the issue**:\n   - Tests failing: Fix the test or the code\n   - Lint failing: Run linter locally and fix issues\n   - Build failing: Check build errors and resolve\n4. **Commit the fix**\n5. **Run code-complete again**\n6. **Repeat until it passes**\n\n**DO NOT**:\n- ❌ Skip code-complete because \"it's probably fine\"\n- ❌ Close the bead with failing quality gates\n- ❌ Commit code that doesn't pass quality gates\n- ❌ Ask user to \"fix it later\"\n\n### Interim vs Final Checks\n\n**During development**: Use `/dots-swe:process-check`\n- Runs quality gates only\n- No push, no labeling\n- Quick feedback loop\n- Run as often as needed\n\n**Before closing**: Use `/dots-swe:code-complete`\n- Runs quality gates\n- Pushes to remote\n- Labels bead as complete\n- Final verification step\n- Run once when done\n\n### Enforcement\n\nThe workflow has enforcement mechanisms:\n1. **Pre-commit hook**: May prompt if code-complete not run\n2. **Doctor command**: Checks for code-complete label\n3. **Integration command**: Expects code-complete label\n\nThese are safety nets. Don't rely on them. Run code-complete proactively.\n\n### Example: Complete Workflow\n\n```bash\n# 1. Squash commits into logical units\n/dots-swe:squash\n\n# 2. Verify everything committed\ngit status  # Should show clean\n\n# 3. Run code-complete (REQUIRED)\n/dots-swe:code-complete\n\n# Output:\n# ✅ Tests passed (23 tests)\n# ✅ Lint passed\n# ✅ Build passed\n# ✅ Pushed to origin/dots-abc-123\n# ✅ Added swe:code-complete label\n# \n# Bead Summary:\n# ID:     dots-abc-123\n# Title:  Add user authentication\n# Status: ready for integration\n\n# 4. Only now: close the bead\nbd close dots-abc-123\n\n# 5. Integration (usually separate session/later)\n/dots-swe:code-integrate dots-abc-123\n```\n```\n\n### Update Existing Sections\n\n**Workflow section** (around line 42):\nAdd between \"Commit changes\" and \"After completing work\":\n\n```markdown\n### 5. Final Verification\n\nBefore closing the bead, run final quality gates:\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n/dots-swe:code-complete\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nThis ensures your work is tested, linted, built, and ready for integration.\n```\n\n**After Completing Work section** (around line 240):\nChange from:\n```markdown\nNext steps:\n- Close the bead: `bd close \u003cbead-id\u003e`\n- Move on to next bead\n```\n\nTo:\n```markdown\nNext steps:\n1. Run final quality gates: `/dots-swe:code-complete`\n2. If code-complete succeeds:\n   - Close the bead: `bd close \u003cbead-id\u003e`\n   - Move on to next bead\n3. If code-complete fails:\n   - Fix the issue\n   - Commit the fix\n   - Run code-complete again\n```\n\n## Why This Works\n\n1. **Impossible to miss**: \"CRITICAL\" header with explicit mandate\n2. **Clear reasoning**: Explains why it matters\n3. **Behavioral guidance**: Shows correct vs incorrect patterns\n4. **Failure handling**: Tells agent what to do when it fails\n5. **Enforcement awareness**: Mentions hooks and checks\n6. **Example workflow**: Shows complete end-to-end pattern\n7. **Repetition**: Mentioned in multiple sections\n8. **Visual emphasis**: ❌ and ✅ symbols, code examples\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Add \"CRITICAL: Before Closing Any Bead\" section after Quality Bar\n- [ ] Section explains what code-complete does (numbered list)\n- [ ] Section shows when to run code-complete (✅ checklist)\n- [ ] Section shows WRONG vs CORRECT patterns (❌/✅ examples)\n- [ ] Section explains why it matters (consequences)\n- [ ] Section covers failure handling (step-by-step)\n- [ ] Section distinguishes process-check vs code-complete\n- [ ] Section shows complete example workflow\n- [ ] Update Workflow section to include code-complete step\n- [ ] Update \"After Completing Work\" section with code-complete requirement\n- [ ] Add enforcement mechanism mentions\n- [ ] Use visual emphasis (❌/✅, CRITICAL, NEVER, MUST)\n- [ ] Test: Agent reads updated swe.md and runs code-complete\n- [ ] Verify section is prominent and impossible to skip\n- [ ] Update version to 2.14.0 (matches protocol change)\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `dots-swe/agents/swe.md` - Add CRITICAL section, update workflow\n- `dots-swe/commands/help.md` - Update agent description\n- `dots-swe/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` - Bump version to 2.14.0\n\n## Integration with Other Solutions\n\nThis bead works in conjunction with:\n- **dots-claude-plugins-oz4**: Pre-commit hook (enforcement)\n- **dots-claude-plugins-rkz**: SESSION CLOSE PROTOCOL (checklist)\n\nTogether they create defense in depth:\n1. **Instructions** (this bead): Education and behavioral guidance\n2. **Protocol** (rkz): Visual checklist reminder\n3. **Hook** (oz4): Hard enforcement\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n1. Update swe.md with new section\n2. Load swe agent in test session\n3. Verify agent sees CRITICAL section\n4. Complete test task\n5. Observe if agent runs code-complete before closing\n6. Test failure scenario (make tests fail)\n7. Verify agent handles failure correctly\n8. Test with agent that hasn't seen new instructions\n9. Compare behavior before/after update\n\n## Success Metrics\n\nBefore change:\n- Agents skip code-complete ~80% of time\n\nTarget after change:\n- Agents skip code-complete \u003c10% of time\n- When skipped, agent catches it before closing bead\n- Failure handling done correctly (fix, commit, retry)\n\n## Rollout Plan\n\n1. Implement changes to swe.md\n2. Bump version to 2.14.0\n3. Test with new sessions\n4. Monitor agent behavior\n5. Iterate on wording if agents still skip\n6. Document in changelog\n\n## Edge Cases\n\n**No quality gates detected**: Code-complete still runs (pushes, labels)\n**Quality gates fail**: Agent should fix and retry, not skip\n**Pre-commit hook not installed**: Agent should still run code-complete\n**GitHub PR workflow**: Slightly different (creates PR instead of local merge)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"objectiveous@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-19T00:00:30.236095-06:00","created_by":"Robert (Kenpo) Evans","updated_at":"2026-01-19T00:55:03.913764-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-19T00:55:03.913764-06:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"dots-claude-plugins-9gg","depends_on_id":"dots-claude-plugins-oz4","type":"relates-to","created_at":"2026-01-19T00:01:00.875929-06:00","created_by":"Robert (Kenpo) Evans"},{"issue_id":"dots-claude-plugins-9gg","depends_on_id":"dots-claude-plugins-rkz","type":"relates-to","created_at":"2026-01-19T00:01:01.046737-06:00","created_by":"Robert (Kenpo) Evans"}],"comments":[{"id":18,"issue_id":"dots-claude-plugins-9gg","author":"Robert (Kenpo) Evans","text":"Part of defense-in-depth strategy with oz4 (hook) and rkz (protocol).

{"id":"dots-claude-plugins-oz4","title":"Add pre-commit hook to enforce code-complete workflow","description":"## Problem\n\nSWE agents consistently skip /dots-swe:code-complete before committing code, despite documentation and guidance. Recent examples:\n- dots-claude-plugins-5va: Committed without running code-complete\n- dots-claude-plugins-ztt: Committed without quality gates\n- dots-claude-plugins-65l: Root cause analysis of this pattern\n\nThis violates the quality gates protocol and defeats the purpose of having automated quality checks.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n### Why Agents Skip Code-Complete\n\n1. **No enforcement mechanism**: Nothing blocks commits without code-complete\n2. **Guidance is passive**: SESSION CLOSE PROTOCOL shows checklist but doesn't enforce it\n3. **Multiple competing patterns**: \n   - SESSION CLOSE PROTOCOL says \"Run quality gates\" (ambiguous)\n   - Git workflow is familiar (git add → git commit)\n   - Agents default to standard git workflow when unsure\n4. **Cognitive load**: By the time work is done, agents focus on \"commit and close\" rather than \"verify quality first\"\n5. **False confidence**: When implementation looks correct, agents assume quality is fine\n6. **No immediate feedback**: Skipping code-complete has no immediate negative consequence\n\n### Why This Is Critical\n\n- **Quality regression**: Code committed without tests/lint/build verification\n- **Protocol erosion**: If skipped once, becomes normalized behavior\n- **Integration failures**: Code that breaks during /dots-swe:code-integrate\n- **Wasted effort**: Having to fix issues that should have been caught earlier\n- **Lost benefits**: Defeats entire purpose of quality gates infrastructure\n\n## Solution: Pre-commit Git Hook\n\nCreate interactive pre-commit hook that checks if bead has swe:code-complete label before allowing commit.\n\n### Implementation\n\n**New command**: `/dots-swe:install-quality-hook`\n\nCreates `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# Pre-commit hook: Enforce code-complete workflow for SWE beads\n\n# Check if we're in a worktree with a bead\nBEAD_ID=$(cat .swe-bead 2\u003e/dev/null)\n\nif [ -z \"$BEAD_ID\" ]; then\n  # Not a bead worktree, allow commit\n  exit 0\nfi\n\n# Check if bead has swe:code-complete label\nif bd show \"$BEAD_ID\" 2\u003e/dev/null | grep -q \"swe:code-complete\"; then\n  # Has label, all good\n  exit 0\nfi\n\n# Missing swe:code-complete label - prompt user\necho \"\"\necho \"━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\"\necho \"⚠️  Quality Gates Check\"\necho \"━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\"\necho \"\"\necho \"Bead: $BEAD_ID\"\necho \"Status: Missing swe:code-complete label\"\necho \"\"\necho \"Before committing completed work, you should run:\"\necho \"  /dots-swe:code-complete\"\necho \"\"\necho \"This will:\"\necho \"  • Run quality gates (test/lint/build)\"\necho \"  • Push to remote\"\necho \"  • Add swe:code-complete label\"\necho \"  • Verify work is ready for integration\"\necho \"\"\necho \"Options:\"\necho \"  [y] Yes, I ran code-complete (proceed with commit)\"\necho \"  [n] No, let me run it now (abort commit)\"\necho \"  [w] This is WIP, skip for now (proceed with commit)\"\necho \"\"\nread -p \"Continue with commit?

When encountering a blocking error:\n   - Create a bead with type=bug\n   - Mark current bead as blocked by the new bug\n   - Stop and inform user\n\n## Example\n\n```bash\n# If agent sees: \"get_integration_resources: command not found\"\nbd create --title=\"Fix undefined function: get_integration_resources\" \\\n  --type=bug --priority=2 \\\n  --description=\"Error in code-integrate.sh:240 - function not defined in swe-lib.sh\"\n```\n\n## Files to Update\n\n- dots-swe/agents/swe.md - Add \"Error Handling\" section with instructions","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"objectiveous@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-18T15:49:40.519125-06:00","created_by":"Robert (Kenpo) Evans","updated_at":"2026-01-18T21:45:47.277022-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-18T21:45:47.277022-06:00","close_reason":"Closed"}
