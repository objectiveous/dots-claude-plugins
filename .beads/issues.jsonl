Local Merge Workflow (Primary)\nSince only one developer and local CI/CD:\n- Update merge commands to prompt for Conventional Commit message\n- Include summary of branch changes in merge commit body\n- Use --no-ff to preserve branch topology\n\n### 2. Squashing Strategy\n- Add pre-merge squash step to workflow\n- Guide users through interactive rebase\n- Keep main branch clean with logical commits\n\n### 3. Commit Hook Enhancement\n- Detect merge commits (start with 'Merge')\n- Allow merge commits to pass (different validation)\n- Continue validating regular commits\n\n### 4.
