Only lines that directly start with `!` are executed as bash commands. The body of loops is displayed as text but NOT executed.\n\n## Example (worktree-create.md)\n\n```markdown\n!for branch in \"$@\"; do\n  BRANCH_NAME=\"$branch\"\n  git worktree add -b \"$BRANCH_NAME\" \"$WORKTREE_DIR\" \"$CURRENT_BRANCH\"  # NOT EXECUTED\ndone\n```\n\nThe `git worktree add` inside the loop never runs - it's just echoed as text. The skill appears to succeed but no worktree is created.\n\n## Affected Commands\n\n- `/dots-dev:worktree-create`\n- `/dots-dev:worktree-delete` \n- Likely others using for loops\n\n## Fix\n\nRefactor skills to use helper functions in `scripts/worktree-lib.sh` instead of inline loops.","created_at":"2026-01-03T18:34:33Z"}]}
